INSTALLATION HOWTO - BRIGITTE
=============================

This howto describes the installation of Brigitte on a Debian 6 instance.


Prerequisites
-------------

We need a preinstalled Debian 6 with some services already running:

- Mail Server (to send password recovery emails and stuff like this)
- Database Server (you don't want to run a production instance on SQLite)
- Web Server (we presume you're using Apache2 with mod_wsgi)
- Caching Server (we will use redis, you can use memcache instead, if you want)
- Supervisor (we use Supervisor to run Git Daemon and Git SSH Server processes)


Prepare installation as superuser/root
--------------------------------------

First of all, install some Debian packages:

    apt-get install git build-essential python-dev python-setuptools

Now, we install two python packages:

    easy_install pip virtualenv

Next step, create a system user for brigitte:

    adduser brigitte


Install brigitte and prepare configuration
------------------------------------------

Log in as the new created user brigitte.

Before we install the needed python requirements for brigitte, we create and
activate a virtualenv:

    virtualenv pyenv
    cd pyenv
    . ./bin/activate

We need to create the repositories folder and generate the ssh key for the
git ssh server:

    mkdir repositories
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -f sshserver_key

Now we can clone the brigitte repository:

    git clone git://github.com/stephrdev/brigitte.git
    cd brigitte

Install the python requirements and brigitte to python path:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python setup.py develop

Go to the brigitte_site directory and create the configuration:

    cd brigitte_site
    cp dev.sample.py settings.py

You need to update the sample config and change the database configuration,
caching configuration and add a secret key. If you want to user a different
location for the repositories, you also need to update the path in this config.

IMPORTANT: If you want to run brigitte in a production environment,
change the DEBUG setting to False.

After updating the configuration, we can prepare the database and
collect static files:

    python manage.py syncdb
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py collectstatic

To test the configuration, you can run

    python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 --insecure

to check if everything works as expected.

Update server configrations and configure supervisor
----------------------------------------------------

You need to activate Brigitte in your webserver. You can find a sample
configuration for Apache2 in the docs folder.
Place the apache2.conf.sample in your Apache2 configuration directory
(/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/) and update the VirtualHost to fit your needs.

You also need to add Git Daemon and Git SSH Server to your supervisor.
Two sample configurations are provided in the docs folder.
Pleace the two files in your Supervisor configuration directory
(/etc/supervisor/conf.d/) and update the paths if needed.
